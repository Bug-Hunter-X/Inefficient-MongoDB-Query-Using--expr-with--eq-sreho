This repository demonstrates an uncommon MongoDB query error involving inefficient use of the $expr operator. The original query uses `$expr` with `$eq` to compare two fields within documents, which can be slower than using `$eq` directly for large datasets. The solution shows how to rewrite the query for improved performance.
